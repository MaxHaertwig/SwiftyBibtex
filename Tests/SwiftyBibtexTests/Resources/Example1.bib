It provides an in - depth understanding of BIM technologies, the business and organizational issues associated with its implementation, and the profound impacts that effective use of BIM can provide to all members of a project team. The book  explains how  designing, constructing,  and operating buildings with BIM differs from  pursuing  the  same  activities in the traditional way  using  drawings, whether paper or electronic. BIM is beginning to change the way buildings look, the way they function, and the ways in which they are built. Throughout the book, we have intentionally and consistently used the term ‘ BIM ’ to describe an activity (meaning building information modeling),  rather than an object (building information model).This reflects our belief that BIM is not a thing or a type of software but a human activity that ultimately involves broad process changes in construction. },

        becomes more powerful in terms of the ability to manipulate large parametric models, the potential grows to build increasingly sophisticated

The most important decisions regarding a building's sustainable features are made during the design and preconstruction stages. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) is the most widely adopted sustainable building rating system in the United States. For projects pursuing LEED®certification, designers have to conduct in-depth sustainability analyses based on a building's form, materials, context, and mechanical – electrical – plumbing (MEP) systems. Since Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows for multi-disciplinary information to be superimposed within one model, it creates an opportunity to conduct these analyses accurately and efficiently as compared to the traditional methods. In this exploratory research, a case study was conducted on Salisbury University's Perdue School of Business building to demonstrate the use of BIM for sustainable design and the LEED®certification process. First, a conceptual framework was developed to establish the relationship between BIM- based sustainability analyses and the LEED®certification process. Next, the framework was validated via this case study. The results of this study indicate that documentation supporting LEED®credits may be directly or indirectly prepared using the results of BIM-based sustainability analyses software. This process could streamline the LEED®certification process and save substantial time and resources which would otherwise be required using traditional methods. },

Although evidence for the majority of these has been found, the matrix is not considered complete, but rather a framework for research to explore the degree of validity of the interactions.

A rule-based engine that utilizes this framework is implemented on top of a commercially available BIM platform to show the feasibility of the approach. As a result, the developed automated safety checking platform informs construction engineers and managers by reporting, why, where, when, and what safety measures are needed for preventing fall-related accidents before construction starts. The safety area reviewed is fall protection. An example case study of such a system is also provided.},

Studies showed that BIM implementation is still a challenge for the North American construction industry. The Canadian construction industry, in contrast, is well behind that of the U.S. in its BIM adoption rate. Maturity and adoption of BIM depends mainly on the client or the owner in construction projects. Public sector clients often think that the market is not ready for BIM and are afraid to increase pro- ject costs by limiting competition. Moreover, if the contractor is not integrated in the project in the design phase, BIM has limited power. This paper proposes a ‘ BIM partnering ’ based public procurement framework to ensure ‘ best value ’ in construction projects. The case study presented in the paper proved the feasibility of proposed BIM based procurement in publicly-funded construction projects.

This paper introduces a Building Information Modeling-based user activity simulation and evaluation method (UASEM), which aims to facilitate the designer-user communications. It assists users to specify their activities in new buildings and simulates these activities based on the building information models. It also helps to conduct a pre-occupancy evaluation. The UASEM was adopted in a case study of a university campus project. The result indicated that this method has potential to improve users’ understanding of the design solutions, especially in terms of spatial properties of the layout. It can also improve users’ confidence to express comments and increase their willingness to collaboratively work with designers.},

Industry’s requirements for graduate engineers were elicited through surveys, workshops, analyses of job advertisements, and in-depth interviews. An outline of 39 topics in three broad classifications was established. Targets for competency in each topic were developed using the cognitive domain of Bloom’s taxonomy, which expresses the learning objectives on six levels (from understand to evaluate). Gap analysis, which compared the state of the art in leading universities to industry requirements, led to the compilation of a framework for the development of BIM content for undergraduate and graduate construction engineering and management degree programs. The requirements and framework are intended to provide educators with essential knowledge as they develop and implement BIM content in their programs.},

Many studies on defect causation analysis and management system have been conducted to facilitate defect measures and rectifications as well as to reduce the reoccurrence of the defect. However, those studies did not sufficiently consider the relationship of defect information flow in the construction process, which resulted in reactive rather than proactive defect management plan. This paper investigates the issues and needs of current defect management practices in the construction industry. It also presents a conceptual system framework for construction defect management that integrates ontology and augmented reality (AR) with building information modeling (BIM). The following three main technical solutions are proposed in the system framework: 1) defect data collection template to assure data quality and accuracy; 2) defect domain ontology to search and retrieve project or work-specific defect information; and 3) AR-based Defect Inspection System to support field defect management. It is envisaged that the system framework and solutions could enable proactive reduction of the defect occurrence during the construction process and that could greatly improve current defect management practices in the construction industry.},

    abstract = {The utilization of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been growing significantly and translating into the support of various tasks within the construction industry. In relation to such a growth, many approaches that leverage dimensions of information stored in BIM model are being developed. Through this, it is possible to allow all stakeholders to retrieve and generate information from the same model, enabling them to work cohesively. To identify gaps of existing work and evaluate new studies in this area, a BIM application framework is developed and discussed in this paper. Such a framework gives an overview of BIM applications in the construction industry. A literature review, within this framework, has been conducted and the result reveals a research gap for BIM applications in the project domains of quality, safety and environmental management. A computable multi-dimensional (nD) model is difficult to establish in these areas because with continuously changing conditions, the decision making rules for evaluating whether an individual component is considered good quality, or whether a construction site is safe, also vary as the construction progresses. A process of expanding from 3D to computable nD models, specifically, a possible way to integrate safety, quality and carbon emission variables into BIM during the construction phase of a project is explained in this paper. As examples, the processes of utilizing nD models on real construction sites are described. It is believed to benefit the industry by providing a computable BIM and enabling all project participants to extract any information required for decision making. Finally, the framework is used to identify areas to extend BIM research.},

This approach involves a 3D modeling stage and the integration of the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further management and analysis. The modeling stage is carried out using a new concept; Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) which has been developed at the Dublin Institute of Technology [12]. Historic Building Information Modeling is a system for modeling historic structures from laser scan and photogrammetric data using Building Information Modeling (BIM) software. The HBIM process involves a reverse engineering solution whereby parametric objects representing architectural elements are mapped onto laser scan or photogrammetric survey data. A library of parametric architectural objects has been designed from historic manuscripts and architectural pattern books. These parametric objects were built using an embedded scripting language within the BIM software called Geometric Descriptive Language (GDL). These objects are combined and mapped onto the survey data to build the entire model. After the 3D model has been created the next stage involves integrating the 3D model into a 3D GIS for further analysis. The international framework for 3D city modeling, CityGML has been adopted for this purpose. CityGML provides an interoperable framework for modeling 3D geometries, semantics, topology and appearance properties [13]. The aim of this research is to bridge the gap between parametric CAD modeling and 3D GIS while using benefits from both systems to help document and analyze cultural heritage sites.},

    abstract = {The Traditional Malay Houses (TMH) in Malaysia are considered as vernacular architecture, built and designed by the locals with thoughtful considerations and appreciation for nature. There are various beneficial features in technical and environmental contexts of a TMH that should be investigated further and applied in the present-day built environment. Due to its modularity and ingenious construction method, it is possible for a TMH to be dismantled, relocated and reconstructed in a new environment, also known as adaptive reuse practice. In Malaysia, a new trend has already emerged among built heritage lovers, business owners, individuals and universities to take the challenge of adaptive reusing abandoned traditional Malay houses for heritage conservation and tourism purposes. This paper aims to explore Building Information Modeling (BIM) usage to analyze the building and environment performance of a typical TMH in an adaptive reuse experiment. The analysis is important in order to maximize the building performance of the TMH once it has been constructed at the new location. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the process of creating and organizing building data during its life cycle. Characteristically it uses three-dimensional building modeling software with smart parametric object features to increase efficiency in building design and construction. With the development of simulation technology in BIM, it is possible to evaluate the environmental performance of a building before the real construction begins. An on-going research project to dismantle, relocate and reconstruct a TMH has been used as a case study to explore the aim of this study. The Malaysia's Green Building Index (GBI) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) guidelines were used to evaluate the design and performance of the TMH. A framework was acquired from literatures to establish the correlation between BIM for sustainable design analysis and the GBI and LEED assessment. The focus of this study is the building orientation and daylight performance. The framework was then justified by the case study. Through the usage of BIM software, in this case Autodesk Revit Architecture, the selected TMH was parametrically remodeled in order to coordinate any changes and maintain the consistency of the building components. The BIM model was then simulated for its building performance through secondary software, Autodesk Green Building Studio and the results were analyzed. The study eventually recommended improvements on the performance of the TMH through modification of some of the architectural components without losing the originality and heritage values of the building. Besides that, this study may also be served as a platform to promote the practice of adaptive reuse for heritage and conservation purposes through effective planning using BIM and its simulation tools.},

    abstract = {This paper presents an experimental method and apparatus of augmented reality (AR) for nDimensional (nD) building information modeling (BIM). BIM allows nD information to be visualized simultaneously by architects, engineers and constructors to gain a synchronized understanding viewing from different perspectives. However, BIM is conventionally being operated on a desktop-based computer which makes collaboration less flexible, and it also creates an isolation gap between the model and reality. This isolation gap does not severely affect experienced and skilled professionals, as they can bridge the isolation gap with their intuition developed over the years. Nevertheless, users who are lack of such experience will feel the isolation gap between the digital realm and practicable reality, which could be the hurdle in project participation and decision making. AR allows virtual content to be mixed with real environment for user experience. In the context of our study, AR is functional to present the nD information of BIM, at the same time retaining users' connection with the reality. It is not just being utilized solely for presentation, but also to maximize the potential for communication, interaction and experience. This pilot study investigates effective technological approach of using AR as an effective collaboration technology combining with BIM through proposed key aspects of contextualization, customization and curation. Contextualization is significant to enable users to understand the AR content by making the presented information meaningful to the target audience, implemented thru the means of 2D annotations, animations and options comparison. This study compares both AR BIM with and without contextualization. Customization can generate unique virtual environment and content for different level of users tailored to their needs and preference to create intuitive interaction with AR BIM. Curation is crucial to provide users with a reliable experience, and to formulate a continually improving AR BIM thru log data and users' feedback. All in all, this paper explores the major aspects of contextualization, customization and curation, to distinguish effective approach in the currently “free for all�? AR BIM development. Finally, an implication is provided for future study in terms of balance in information sufficiency and complexity for AR BIM.},

To enhance the ability of disaster prevention and relief, it is necessary to develop the management system of disaster prevention and relief based on building information modeling. The system will be much more intuitive than before with the BIM technology and all the data can be stored in BIM model. This paper discusses about how to develop such a management system. Considering the advantage and disadvantage of B/S and C/S structure, B/S structure is used in our system. We separate the data from the model and import the data into the relational database for management. To utilize the strength of GIS, we combined the geometric solid model with triangulated irregular network model in the system. And the system also provides some useful function to the users such as disaster simulation, public education, escape route analysis etc, which can offer strong support to emergency response, command dispatching and decision analysis.},

Indeed, they will be no longer designed and managed only as financial products, but also as service providers to support the needs of the occupants. This is a great challenge in the building sector, that is experiencing a period of various (r)evolution concerning products, technologies and processes. This research defines a digitally enabled framework for operating cognitive buildings, presenting a case study by which it has been possible to analyze how information collected during operations could inform end-users (i.e. administrators, owners, facility managers and occupants) about the behavior of both buildings and occupants. Focusing on building in-use stages, advantages in tracking the behavior of occupants and in satisfying the needs of users should be derived through the availability of real-time information, i.e. collected by sensors. In this way, not only the behavior of users could be taken into account, but also predicted performance could be correlated with real measurement and, consequently, the building performance gap should be estimated and filled. A connection between as-designed virtual models (resulted from a BIM - Building Information Modeling - process) and as-delivered physical assets (monitored in real-time, i.e. through BMS - Building Management Systems) could be established to explore how BIM practices and technologies could improve a data-driven asset management, by enriching building information in operation. The results should allow pointing out how data and information gathered along building life cycle could provide services to users.},

In this paper, we summarizes other Chinese scholars suggested for the BIM application in China and try to present what is the most reasonable economic policy, which is inevitably impeded by the result of the existence of externalities. Moreover, the establishment of Dynamic Game Model based on complete information is firstly proposed among enterprises and government. The overall aim of the Model is to help government to promote Economic Policy. It is concluded that Economic incentive effect is the key factor to whether government improve BIM's development. If the incentive effect is obvious, no matter what responses from other people, the government will resolutely promote economic incentive policies. Therefore, we suggest that the government should adopt BIM applications economic incentive mechanism, including "supply side oriented", "carrot and stick", and "Stage-style" for different interest subjects of economic stimulus policy.},

    abstract = {Lifecycle and effective dada management has become and still remains a difficult task in architecture, engineering, and construction domain. Recently, the emerging Building Information Modeling (BIM) gains more and more momentum in construction data presenting, processing, and sharing. With precise 3D digital geometry graphs, BIM has the potential to integrate diverse data from construction phases (design, construction, maintenance) and therefore becomes a promising collaboration platform for involved personnel. High efficiency BIM model processing is one of the critical issues for construction industry to truly embrace BIM technology. However, this topic has been rarely studied compared with other issues in BIM research. This paper presents an augmented version of MapReduce (MR), the popular distributed parallel computing model, to solve this problem. The main contribution lies in two points: 1) BIM models are extracted into uneven partitions according to construction domain features, followed by a specifically designed pre-process mechanism, which solves the unsuitability of classical MR's even blocking in construction domain and further greatly improves performance; 2) process and thread level parallel computing techniques are introduced into MR in single node to form a two-tier hybrid parallel architecture, which is more adaptive to BIM's massive graphical data processing. The proposed framework has been successfully used in real business applications of project quantity computation and BIM model collision detection. Experiment result from lab environment proves its efficiency and usability.},

BIM is actually a process (not a software, as someone indicated), in which different players act sharing data through digital models in a coordinated, consistent and always up to date workflow, in order to reach reliability and higher quality all over the construction process. This way BIM tools were originally meant to ease the design of new architectures, generated by parametric geometries connected through hierarchical relationships of “smart objects�? (components self-aware of their identity and conscious of their interactions with each other). However, this approach can also be successfully applied to what already exists: TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) or digital photogrammetry are supposed to be the first abstraction step in a methodology proposal intended as a scientific strategy in which BIM, relying on its own semantic splitting attitude and its topological structure, is explicitly used in representation of existing buildings belonging to the Cultural Heritage. Presenting some progresses in the development of a specific free Autodesk Revit plug-in, nicknamed GreenSpider after its capability to layout points in the digital domain as if they were nodes of an ideal cobweb, this paper examines how point clouds collected during high definition surveys can be processed with accuracy in a BIM environment, highlighting critical aspects and advantages deriving from the application of parametric techniques to the real world domain representation.},
