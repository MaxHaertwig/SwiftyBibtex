    abstract = {We present a non-analytic approach to self-assessment for Autonomic
        Computing. Our approach leverages utility functions, at the level
        of an autonomic application, or even a single task or feature being
        exercised within that application. This paper describes the fundamental
        steps of our approach: instrumentation of the application; collection
        of exhaustive samples of runtime data about relevant quality attributes
        of the application, as well as characteristics of its runtime environment;
        elicitation of a utility function through statistical correlation
        over the collected data points; and embedding of code corresponding
        to the equation of the elicited utility function within the runtime
        of the application, which enables online evaluation of utility values.
        To illustrate our elicitation method, as well as our framework for
        instrumentation, monitoring, and utility function embedding/evaluation,
        we discuss our experience with two different case studies, with their
        results and implications.},

    abstract = {Automatic discovery and monitoring of IT resources is a critical part
        of enterprise systems management. In addition to ascertaining internal
        device configurations, this discovery process may also need to capture
        the capabilities, usage, connectivity, availability, and other information
        related to various IT components. Systems resource management (SRM)
        tools typically implement this discovery process using device specific
        APIs, custom agents and/or some standard-based solution (like WBEM
        and CIM). The discovery actions need to be systematically planned;
        an inefficient implementation or scheduling may easily take from
        a few minutes to several hours to complete in a large heterogeneous
        enterprise datacenter. This paper discusses the various challenges
        associated in discovering a datacenter environment and presents an
        autonomic monitoring framework called 'ParaDisE' that builds upon
        well-known industry standards and reduces the overall discovery time

        almost all decisions concerning runtime composition and adaptation
        to be deferred beyond deployment. Dynamic context management contributes
        to flexibility. The architecture is extensible, and can embed potentially
        many different self-management decision technologies simultaneously.
        The mechanism that implements the run-time configuration has been
        designed to be very robust, automatically and silently handling problems
        arising from the evaluation of self- management logic and ensuring
        that in the worst case the dynamic aspects of the system collapse

        components to suit ambient operating conditions. By using a suite
        of ESOs tuned for different tradeoffs between real-time responsiveness
        and extent of system disturbance tolerated, and a policy mechanism
        to contextually select the most appropriate observer at any given

    abstract = {The MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge)
        feedback loop is the most influential reference control model for
        autonomic and self-adaptive systems. This paper presents a conceptual
        and methodological framework for formal modeling, validating, and
        verifying distributed self-adaptive systems. We show how MAPE-K loops
        for self-adaptation can be naturally specified in an abstract stateful
        language like Abstract State Machines. In particular, we exploit
        the concept of multi-agent Abstract State Machines to specify decentralized
        adaptation control by using MAPE computations. We support techniques
        for validating and verifying adaptation scenarios, and getting feedback
        of the correctness of the adaptation logic as implemented by the
        MAPE-K loops. In particular, a verification technique based on meta-properties
        is proposed to allow discovering unwanted interferences between MAPE-K
        loops at the early stages of the system design. As a proof-of-concepts,
        we model and analyze a traffic monitoring system.},

    abstract = {Streaming model transformations represent a novel class of transformations
        to manipulate models whose elements are continuously produced or
        modified in high volume and with rapid rate of change. Executing
        streaming transformations requires efficient techniques to recognize
        activated transformation rules over a live model and a potentially
        infinite stream of events. In this paper, we propose foundations
        of streaming model transformations by innovatively integrating incremental
        model query, complex event processing (CEP) and reactive (event-driven)
        transformation techniques. Complex event processing allows to identify
        relevant patterns and sequences of events over an event stream. Our
        approach enables event streams to include model change events which
        are automatically and continuously populated by incremental model
        queries. Furthermore, a reactive rule engine carries out transformations
        on identified complex event patterns. We provide an integrated domain-specific
        language with precise semantics for capturing complex event patterns
        and streaming transformations together with an execution engine,
        all of which is now part of the Viatra reactive transformation framework.
        We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with two case studies:
        one in an advanced model engineering workflow; and one in the context
        of on-the-fly gesture recognition.},

        and survivability requirements. At the same time, controlling self-organising
        software to ensure global system properties and functions is a difficult

        or archetypes, replicated across a set of identical agents, and interpreted
        at runtime to control the agents' self-organising behaviour and results.
        The solution ensures, by construction, that any resulting software
        system meets a set of predefined goals, or constraints, while maintaining
        many of the self-organisation related advantages. A framework prototype
        was implemented and tested to show the viability of the proposed

    abstract = {The paper describes a model based approach for architecture design
        of runtime reconfigurable, large-scale, networked signal processing
        applications. A graph based modeling formalism is introduced to describe
        all relevant aspects of the design (functional, concurrency, hardware,
        communication, energy, etc.). The formalism can be used to evaluate
        and suggest architectural patterns for signal processing type of
        applications. Moreover, an architecture design evaluation tool according
        to the modeling formalism is described, which can place the system
        design under various execution scenarios (e.g. node mobility, node
        failure, communication link deterioration, etc.) and determine emerging
        system properties (such as expected lifetime, availability of services,
        throughput, response times, etc.). Distinguishing feature of the
        tool is that it allows for modeling runtime reconfiguration solutions
        (e.g. distributed optimization, constraint solvers) and making changes
        in the underlying system architecture and thus evaluate the effects
        of the reconfiguration. The evaluation tool can be embedded into
        a design optimizer, which allows an optimal trade-off between design-time
        and runtime configuration to be determined. The effectiveness of
        the approach and the tool is demonstrated via two application cases
        (structural integrity monitoring, greenhouse temperature distribution
        estimation).},

        for automating elastic-scaling of in-memory transactional data grids,
        such as NoSQL data stores or Distributed Transactional Memories.
        Applications of TAS range from on-line self-optimization of in-production
        applications to automatic generation of QoS/cost driven elastic scaling
        policies, and support for what-if analysis on the scalability of
        transactional applications. The key innovation at the core of TAS
        is a novel performance forecasting methodology that relies on the
        joint usage of analytical modeling and machine-learning. By exploiting
        these two, classically competing, methodologies in a synergic fashion,
        TAS achieves the best of the two worlds, namely high extrapolation
        power and good accuracy even when faced with complex workloads deployed
        over public cloud infrastructures. We demonstrate the accuracy and
        feasibility of TAS via an extensive experimental study based on a
        fully fledged prototype implementation, integrated with a popular
        open-source transactional in-memory data store (Red Hat's Infinispan),

    abstract = {Autonomic computing components and services require continuous monitoring
        capabilities for collecting and analyzing data of runtime behavior.
        Particularly for software systems, a trade-off between monitoring
        coverage and performance overhead is necessary. In this paper, we
        propose an approach for localizing performance anomalies in software
        systems employing self-adaptive monitoring. Time series analysis
        of operation response times, incorporating architectural information
        about the diagnosed software system, is employed for anomaly localization.
        Comprising quality of service data, such as response times, resource
        utilization, and anomaly scores, OCL-based monitoring rules specify
        the adaptive monitoring coverage. This enables to zoom into a system's
        or component's internal realization in order to locate root causes
        of software failures and to prevent failures by early fault determination
        and correction. The approach has been implemented as part of the
        Kieker monitoring and analysis framework. The evaluation presented
        in this paper focuses on monitoring overhead, response time forecasts,
        and the anomaly detection process.},

        security mechanisms based on knowledge from security ontology. Security
        adaptation is required because a software's environment changes during
        run-time. Thus, all security requirements cannot be defined beforehand.
        To achieve security adaptation, we have combined a security ontology
        that defines security mechanisms, security objectives, and high level
        security measurements. The run-time security adaptation utilises
        this security ontology to adapt security mechanisms or their parameters
        to fulfil security requirements for each environment and usage situation.
        The novelty of this approach comes from the utilisation of ontologies
        and security measurements, which makes adaptation flexible. We validate
        our security adaptation with a case study in a smart space environment.
        The case study proves that security adaptation is able to work autonomously
        without other user actions.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a semantic-driven approach to system modeling
        for improving the accuracy of anomaly diagnosis. Our framework composes
        heterogeneous families of models, including generic statistical models,
        and resource-specific models into a belief network, i.e., Bayesian
        network. Given a set of models which sense the behavior of various
        system components, the key idea is to incorporate expert knowledge
        about the system structure and dependencies within this structure,
        as meta-correlations across components and models. Our approach is
        flexible, easily extensible and does not put undue burden on the
        system administrator. Expert beliefs about the system hierarchy,
        relationships and known problems can guide learning, but do not need
        to be fully specified. The system dynamically evolves its beliefs
        about anomalies over time. We evaluate our prototype implementation
        on a dynamic content site running the TPC-W industry-standard e-
        commerce benchmark. We sketch a system structure and train our belief
        network using automatic fault injection. We demonstrate that our
        technique provides accurate problem diagnosis in cases of single
        and multiple faults. We also show that our semantic-driven modeling
        approach effectively finds the component containing the root cause
        of injected anomalies, and avoids false alarms for normal changes
        in environment or workload.},

        for automatic scaling with temperature awareness in the database
        tier of a dynamic content Web server. We use a unified approach to
        achieving the joint objectives of performance, efficient resource
        usage and avoiding temperature hot-spots in a replicated database
        cluster. The key novelty in our approach is a lightweight on-line
        learning method for fast adaptations to bottleneck situations. Our
        approach is based on deriving a lightweight performance model of
        the replicated database cluster on the fly. The system trains its
        own model based on perceived correlations between various system
        and application metrics and the query latency for the application.
        The model adjusts itself dynamically to changes in the application
        workload mix. We use our performance model for query latency pre
        diction and determining the number of database replicas necessary
        to meet the incoming load. We adapt by adding the necessary replicas,
        pro-actively in anticipation of a bottleneck situation and we remove
        them automatically in underload. Finally, the system adjusts its
        query scheduling algorithm dynamically in order to avoid temperature
        hot- spots within the replicated database cluster. We investigate
        our transparent database provisioning mechanism in the database tier
        using the TPC-W industry- standard e-commerce benchmark. We demonstrate
        that our technique provides quality of service in terms of both performance
        and avoiding hot-spot machines under different load scenarios. We
        further show that our method is robust to dynamic changes in the
        workload mix of the application.},

        system. Specifically, we generate UML state diagrams for a set of
        interacting objects, including the extension of existing state diagrams
        to support new behavior. The approach is based on digital evolution,
        a form of evolutionary computation that enables a designer to explore
        an enormous solution space for complex problems. In our application
        of this technology, an evolving population of digital organisms is
        subjected to natural selection, where organisms are rewarded for
        generating state diagrams that support key scenarios and satisfy
        critical properties as specified by the developer. To achieve this

        execution of cyber-physical systems to represent their context and
        to reason about their runtime behaviour. However, current modeling
        techniques do not allow to cope at the same time with the large-scale,
        distributed, and constantly changing nature of these systems. In
        this paper, we introduce a distributed models@run.time approach,
        combining ideas from reactive programming, peer-to-peer distribution,
        and large-scale models@run.time. We define distributed models as
        observable streams of chunks that are exchanged between nodes in
        a peer-to-peer manner. A lazy loading strategy allows to transparently
        access the complete virtual model from every node, although chunks
        are actually distributed across nodes. Observers and automatic reloading
        of chunks enable a reactive programming style. We integrated our
        approach into the Kevoree Modeling Framework and demonstrate that
        it enables frequently changing, reactive distributed models that
        can scale to millions of elements and several thousand nodes.},

        systems},
    journal = {Software {\&} Systems Modeling},
    year = {2017},
    month = "Feb",
    abstract = {Cyber-physical systems reconfigure the structure of their software
        architecture, e.g., to avoid hazardous situations and to optimize
        operational conditions like their energy consumption. These reconfigurations
        have to be safe so that the systems protect their users or environment
        against harmful conditions or events while changing their structure.
        As software architectures are typically built on components, reconfiguration
        actions need to take into account the component structure. This structure
        should support vertical composition to enable hierarchically encapsulated
        components. While many reconfiguration approaches for cyber-physical
        and embedded real-time systems allow the use of hierarchically embedded
        components, i.e., vertical composition, none of them offers a modeling
        and verification solution to take hierarchical composition, i.e.,
        encapsulation, into account thus limiting reuse and compositional
        verification. In this paper, we present an extension to our existing
        modeling language, MechatronicUML, to enable safe hierarchical reconfigurations.
        The three extensions are (a) an adapted variant of the 2-phase-commit
        protocol to initiate reconfigurations that maintain component encapsulation,
        (b) the integration of feedback controllers during reconfiguration,
        and (c) a verification approach based on (timed) model checking for
        instances of our model. We illustrate our approach on a case study
        in the area of smart railway systems by showing two different use
        cases of our approach. We show that using our approach the systems
        can be easily designed to reconfigure safely.},

        fragments to be distributed and connected to form complex applications.
        There may be potentially tens of thousands of interdependent and
        heterogeneous program fragments running across thousands of nodes.
        While the scale and interconnection imply the need for automation
        to manage the program fragments, the need is intensified because
        the applications operate on live streaming data and thus need to
        be highly available. System-S has been designed with components that
        autonomically manage the program fragments, but the system components
        themselves are also susceptible to failures which can jeopardize
        the system and its applications. The work we present addresses the
        self healing nature of these management components in System-S. In
        particular, we show how one key component of System-S, the job management
        orchestrator, can be abruptly terminated and then recover without
        interrupting any of the running program fragments by reconciling
        with other autonomous system components. We also describe techniques
        that we have developed to validate that the system is able to autonomically
        respond to a wide variety of error conditions including the abrupt
        termination and recovery of key system components. Finally, we show
        the performance of the job management orchestrator recovery for a
        variety of workloads.},

    abstract = {Optimizing self-evolving and dynamically changing systems is a grand
        challenge. In order to apply optimizations almost all conventional
        optimization techniques require a runtime system model. However,
        system models and their solution techniques vary in their strengths
        and limitations. For a rigid system, a single system model is acceptable.
        But if the system is constantly changing its structure then a rigid
        model is not able to represent the system properly, resulting in
        an inefficient use of technique in some cases. Therefore, in this
        paper we propose a framework for an optimization engine that adapts
        the optimization technique based on the system state. The adaptation
        involves selection of techniques based on historical statistics and
        current data, and dynamic generation of a model at runtime. This
        runtime model is then used to apply a relevant optimization technique
        to find a desired optimization plan for the system. We have evaluated
        the proposed framework on an electricity distribution system. Our
        results show that the proposed framework is adaptable, fast and able
        to manage numerous situations.},

    abstract = {The importance of continuous delivery and the emergence of tools allowing
        to treat infrastructure configurations programmatically have revolutionized
        the way computing resources and software systems are managed. However,
        these tools keep lacking an explicit model representation of underlying
        resources making it difficult to introspect, verify or reconfigure
        the system in response to external events. In this paper, we outline
        a novel approach that treats system infrastructure as explicit runtime
        models. A key benefit of using such models@run.time representation
        is that it provides a uniform semantic foundation for resources monitoring
        and reconfiguration. Adopting models at runtime allows one to integrate
        different aspects of system management, such as resource monitoring
        and subsequent verification into an unified view which would otherwise
        have to be done manually and require to use different tools. It also
        simplifies the development of various self-adaptation strategies
        without requiring the engineers and researchers to cope with low-level
        system complexities.},

    abstract = {To effectively manage large-scale data centers and utility clouds,
        operators must understand current system and application behaviors.
        This requires continuous monitoring along with online analysis of
        the data captured by the monitoring system. As a result, there is
        a need to move to systems in which both tasks can be performed in
        an integrated fashion, thereby better able to drive online system
        management. Coining the term 'monalytics' to refer to the combined
        monitoring and analysis systems used for managing large-scale data
        center systems, this paper articulates principles for monalytics
        systems, describes software approaches for implementing them, and
        provides experimental evaluations justifying principles and implementation
        approach. Specific technical contributions include consideration
        of scalability across both 'space' and 'time', the ability to dynamically
        deploy and adjust monalytics functionality at multiple levels of
        abstraction in target systems, and the capability to operate across
        the range of application to hypervisor layers present in large-scale
        data center or cloud computing systems. Our monalytics implementation
        targets virtualized systems and cloud infrastructures, via the integration

    abstract = {Self-Modeling Systems are computing systems that have complete models
        of their own behavior, down to some level of detail, and that interpret
        those models to produce that behavior (in some applications, the
        interpreter itself is also modeled). Then when the system changes
        the models, it changes its own behavior. We have shown how our Wrappings
        integration infrastructure facilitates the construction, operation,
        and management of these systems, and the appropriate limitation of
        their variability. In this paper, we argue that the internal reflective
        processes are well-suited to representation by different languages,
        and that as more languages are used, each one can be simpler in definition
        and in its relationships to semiotically neighboring ones. Furthermore,
        the seeming proliferation of internal languages can be organized
        to have very little performance impact, since constant mappings can
        be made directly through partial evaluation. In computing terms,
        we are showing the useful separation into granularity and abstraction
        layers of the different kinds of activity descriptions needed in
        the models. We illustrate the methods and approach on CARS (Computational
        Architecture for Reflective Systems), a testbed for studying cooperating

        measures to anticipate future trends. To yield accurate predictions,
        intelligent systems not only rely on single numerical values, but
        also on structured models aggregated from different sensors. Computation
        theory, based on the discretization of observable data into timed
        events, can easily lead to millions of values. Time series and similar
        database structures can efficiently index the mere data, but quickly
        reach computation and storage limits when it comes to structuring
        and processing IoT data. We propose a concept of continuous models
        that can handle high-volatile IoT data by defining a new type of
        meta attribute, which represents the continuous nature of IoT data.
        On top of traditional discrete object-oriented modeling APIs, we
        enable models to represent very large sequences of sensor values
        by using mathematical polynomials. We show on various IoT datasets
        that this significantly improves storage and reasoning efficiency.},

    abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly complex and are controlling
        critical activities in many different domains. The traditional assumption
        that these systems will work in a controlled context is slightly
        vanishing. Therefore, it emerges the need of methodologies able to
        determine under what conditions desired goals will be achieved and
        behavioural strategies will be preserved despite (often unavoidable)
        adaptations. In this paper we use the cognitive psychology concept
        of schema to identify the set of properties that an adaptable system
        has to maintain when adapting to changed context. The methodology
        we propose, called AC-contract (Adaptable Code-contract), starts
        from high-level requirements and identifies properties that should
        hold locally on single parts of the system. Local properties are
        represented as contracts directly on the programming language. Specifically,
        AC-contract is able to embed logical propositions in the source code
        as annotations; moreover, it enables verification of adaptable code
        by exploiting a preprocessor that executes the annotations. The methodology
        is applied to a mobile application supporting travellers during their
        journey.},

    abstract = {In this paper we investigate the properties of a cognitive heuristics
        based approach, by way of which the mobile devices of users can become
        aware of the physical environment surrounding them. Cognitive heuristics
        are the mental models used in cognitive psychology to describe how
        human brains efficiently process the huge amount of information constantly
        coming from the environment around us. As personal mobile devices
        represent proxies in the cyber world of their human users, we investigate
        how the same cognitive heuristics can be used by mobile devices to
        become self-aware of the features of the physical environment around
        their users. Specifically, we assume that physical locations are
        described as a network of tags. We consider a self-organising opportunistic
        network environment, where devices exchange information when meeting
        directly. We propose algorithms based on cognitive heuristics through
        which users' nodes obtain tags either directly when coming in proximity
        of locations, or indirectly through other nodes they meet. We analyse
        the properties of the networks of tags resulting at individual nodes,
        as they emerge from this process, as a function of various cognitive
        parameters. We show that using cognitive heuristics leads, under
        the same resource constraints, to much more effective information
        diffusion with respect to other reference solutions. Interestingly,
        we find critical thresholds for key parameters that discriminate
        between information diffusion and information loss. Finally, we show
        that, despite resource constraints, the structure of the network
        of tags at individual nodes is remarkably close to the ideal that
        would be obtained with infinite resources.},

    abstract = {Self-adaptation is a prominent property for developing complex distributed
        software systems. Notable approaches to deal with self-adaptation
        are the runtime goal model artifacts. Goals are generally invariant
        along the system lifecycle but contain points of variability for
        allowing the system to decide among many alternative behaviors. This
        work investigates how it is possible to provide goal models at run-time
        that do not contain tasks, i.e. the description of how to address
        goals, thus breaking the design-time tie up between Tasks and Goals,
        generally outcome of a means-end analysis. In this vision the system
        is up to decide how to combine its available Capabilities: the Proactive
        Means-End Reasoning. The impact of this research line is to implement
        a goal-oriented form of self-adaptation where goal models can be
        injected at runtime. The paper also introduces MUSA, a Middleware
        for User-driven Service self-Adaptation.},

        and adaptivity are key characteristics of next generation distributed
        systems. The reason for that is not least the advent of computing
        trends like Ubiquitous Computing, Ambient Intelligence, and Cyber
        Physical Systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration
        and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being
        open and adaptive it is a common requirement for such systems to
        be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice
        and state-of-the-art, are not sufficient in this context. We recently
        developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional safety
        certificates and corresponding runtime analyses. In this paper we
        show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end we present
        in detail how to specify conditional safety certificates, how to
        transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models
        finally support dynamic safety evaluations.},

        Consequently, transaction monitoring in enterprise environments often
        involves the manual collation of information spread across a variety
        of infrastructure elements and applications, and is a time- consuming
        and labor-intensive task. To facilitate self- governance in enterprise
        environments, we present an online, non-intrusive and platform-agnostic
        solution for transaction monitoring, where the only inputs required
        are (a) system log files in which footprints left by ongoing transaction
        instances are recorded, and (b) a model of the transaction, in terms
        of the valid sequences of steps that a transaction instance may execute
        and the expected footprint patterns at each step. Given these, our
        solution generates a dynamic execution profile of ongoing transaction
        instances that allows their status to be tracked at individual and
        aggregate levels, even when transaction footprints do not necessarily
        carry correlating identifiers as injected through instrumentation.
        We describe our monitoring architecture and algorithms, results from

    abstract = {In order to meet service level agreements (SLAs) and to maintain peak
        performance for database management systems (DBMS), database administrators
        (DBAs) need to implement policies for effective workload scheduling,
        admission control, and resource provisioning. Accurately predicting
        response times of DBMS queries is necessary for a DBA to effectively
        achieve these goals. This task is particularly challenging due to
        the fact that a database workload typically consists of many concurrently
        running queries and an accurate model needs to capture their interactions.
        Additional challenges are introduced when DBMSes are run in dynamic
        cloud computing environments, where workload, data, and physical
        resources can change frequently, on-the-fly. Building an efficient
        and highly accurate online DBMS performance model that is robust
        in the face of changing workloads, data evolution, and physical resource
        allocations is still an unsolved problem. In this work, our goal
        is to build such an online performance model for database appliances
        using an experiment-driven modeling approach. We use a Bayesian approach
        and build novel Gaussian models that take into account the interaction
        among concurrently executing queries and predict response times of
        individual DBMS queries. A key feature of our modeling approach is
        that the models can be updated online in response to new queries
        or data, or changing resource allocations. We experimentally demonstrate
        that our models are accurate and effective -- our best models have
        an average prediction error of 16.3% in the worst case.},

    abstract = {Applications in virtualized data centers are often subject to Service
        Level Objectives (SLOs) regarding their performance (e.g., latency
        or throughput). In order to fulfill these SLOs, it is necessary to
        allocate sufficient resources of different types (CPU, memory, I/O,
        etc.) to an application. However, the relationship between the application
        performance and the resource allocation is complex and depends on
        multiple factors including application architecture, system configuration,
        and workload demands. In this paper, we present a model-based approach
        to ensure that the application performance meets the user-defined
        SLO efficiently by runtime "vertical scaling" (i.e., adding or removing
        resources) of individual virtual machines (VMs) running the application.
        A layered performance model describing the relationship between the
        resource allocation and the observed application performance is automatically
        extracted and updated online using resource demand estimation techniques.
        Such a model is then used in a feedback controller to dynamically
        adapt the number of virtual CPUs of individual VMs. We have implemented
        the controller on top of the VMware vSphere platform and evaluated
        it in a case study using a real-world email and groupware server.
        The experimental results show that our approach allows the managed
        application to achieve SLO satisfaction in spite of workload demand
        variation while avoiding oscillations commonly observed with state-of-the-art
        threshold-based controllers.},

    abstract = {Despite advances in software engineering, software faults continue
        to cause system downtime. Software faults are difficult to detect
        before the system fails, especially since the first symptom of a
        fault is often system failure itself. This paper presents a computational
        geometry technique and a supporting tool to tackle the problem of
        timely fault detection during the execution of a software application.
        The approach in- volves collecting a variety of runtime measurements
        and building a geometric enclosure, such as a convex hull, which
        represents the normal (i.e., non-failing) operating space of the
        application being monitored. When collected runtime measurements
        are classified as being outside of the enclosure, the application
        is considered to be in an anomalous (i.e., failing) state. This paper
        presents exper- imental results that illustrate the advantages of
        using a computational geometry approach over the distance based approaches
        of Chi-Squared and Mahalanobis distance. Additionally, we present
        results illustrating the advantages of using the convex-hull enclosure

        Models help to organize knowledge and emphasize the structure of

        techniques is widely adopted during software construction, it is
        still an open research topic if models can also be used to make runtime

        are suitable for manual analysis and which model elements can be

    abstract = {The increasing availability of smartphones, cameras, and wearables
        with instant data sharing capabilities, and the exploitation of social
        networks for information broadcast, heralds a future of real-time
        information overload. With the growing excess of worldwide streaming
        data, such as images, geotags, text annotations, and sensory measurements,
        an increasingly common service will become one of data summarization.
        The objective of such a service will be to obtain a representative
        sampling of large data streams at a configurable granularity, in
        real-time, for subsequent consumption by a range of data-centric
        applications. This paper describes a general-purpose self-summarizing
        storage service, called Social Trove, for social sensing applications.
        The service summarizes data streams from human sources, or sensors
        in their possession, by hierarchically clustering received information
        in accordance with an application-specific distance metric. It then
        serves a sampling of produced clusters at a configurable granularity
        in response to application queries. While Social Trove is a general
        service, we illustrate its functionality and evaluate it in the specific
        context of workloads collected from Twitter. Results show that Social
        Trove supports a high query throughput, while maintaining a low access
        latency to the produced real-time application-specific data summaries.
        As a specific application case-study, we implement a fact-finding
        service on top of Social Trove.},

        of autonomic systems to realize more powerful adaptation steps, which
        observe and adjust not only parameters but also the software architecture.
        However, monitoring as well as adaptation of the architecture of
        a running system in addition to the parameters are considerably more
        complex and only rather limited and costly solutions are available
        today. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach to ease the
        development of architectural monitoring and adaptation for autonomic
        systems. Using meta models and model transformation techniques, we
        were able to realize an incremental synchronization between the run-time
        system and models for different self-management activities. The synchronization
        might be triggered when needed and therefore the activities can operate
        concurrently.},

        hardware and software failures, load variation and variations in
        user interaction with the system. The self adaptation can be achieved
        by tuning the software, balancing the load or through hardware provisioning.
        This paper investigates a feed-forward adaptation scheme in which
        tuning and provisioning decisions are based on a dynamic predictive
        performance model of the system and the software. The model consists
        of a layered queuing network whose parameters are tuned by tracking
        the system with an Extended Kalman Filter. An optimization algorithm
        searches the system configuration space by using the predictive performance
        model to evaluate every configuration.},

    abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are designed to resolve unknown behaviors by extracting commonalities over massive datasets. Unfortunately, learning such global behaviors can be inaccurate and slow for systems composed of heterogeneous elements, which behave very differently, for instance as it is the case for cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things applications. Instead, to make smart decisions, such systems have to continuously refine the behavior on a per-element basis and compose these small learning units together. However, combining and composing learned behaviors from different elements is challenging and requires domain knowledge. Therefore, there is a need to structure and combine the learned behaviors and domain knowledge together in a flexible way. In this paper we propose to weave machine learning into domain modeling. More specifically, we suggest to decompose machine learning into reusable, chainable, and independently computable small learning units, which we refer to as microlearning units. These microlearning units are modeled together with and at the same level as the domain data. We show, based on a smart grid case study, that our approach can be significantly more accurate than learning a global behavior, while the performance is fast enough to be used for live learning.},
